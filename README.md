## About Me

I am a developer with a strong focus on infrastructure, system design, and web-based tooling.  
My work spans across backend services, lightweight frontends, and cloud-native deployments, with an emphasis on **stability, simplicity, and long-term maintainability**.

I enjoy building practical tools, optimizing workflows, and exploring how modern platforms can be combined to deliver clean and efficient solutions.

## Technical Focus

- **Backend & Services**
  - RESTful APIs
  - Service orchestration
  - Automation scripts and task scheduling

- **Web & Frontend**
  - Pure HTML / CSS based static sites
  - Lightweight UI without heavy frameworks
  - Performance-oriented design

- **Infrastructure**
  - Linux-based environments
  - Containerized services (Docker)
  - Reverse proxy & traffic routing
  - Cloudflare / edge deployment scenarios

- **Tooling & Workflow**
  - Git-based workflows
  - CI-friendly project structures
  - Minimal but effective documentation

## Selected Interests

- System reliability and fault tolerance  
- Developer experience (DX) optimization  
- Static-site driven projects  
- Low-cost, high-availability deployments  
- Clean UI with a technical aesthetic

## Open Source Philosophy

I believe open source should be:

- **Readable** – clear structure and naming
- **Reusable** – easy to adapt to real-world use
- **Honest** – no unnecessary complexity

Some repositories are experiments, others are utilities refined over time.  
Each project reflects a specific problem and its most direct solution.

---

## Current Direction

- Exploring edge-first deployment models  
- Refining small but complete web projects  
- Improving documentation and usability of existing tools
